# Iot_phase5
Hardware Setup:Set up your IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi or similar hardware.Sensor Data Collection:Read data from the soil moisture, weather station, and flow sensors. Here's a simple Python script to read data from a soil moisture sensor using the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. You'd need to install the required libraries and adapt it for your specific sensor.import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Set GPIO pin mode
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
# Read data from the sensor
def read_soil_moisture(pin):
    # Your sensor reading logic here
    return sensor_value

# Example usage
soil_moisture_value = read_soil_moisture(17)Data Processing:Process and analyze the sensor data. You can use Python libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation. For example, calculating average soil moisture levels:import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have data in a DataFrame 'sensor_data'
average_soil_moisture = sensor_data['soil_moisture'].mean()Transit Information Platform:Develop a web-based dashboard using a Python web framework (e.g., Flask). You'd need to install Flask and any other required packages. Here's a simple example:from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Render a template with data
    return render_template('dashboard.html', average_soil_moisture=average_soil_moisture)

if _name_ == '_main_':
    app.run(debug=True)Data Integration:Create APIs or database connections to integrate your sensor data with the web platform. You can use Flask for this purpose.Irrigation Control Logic:Implement irrigation control logic based on the sensor data. For example, using if statements to control irrigation:if average_soil_moisture < threshold:
    # Trigger irrigation
    control_irrigation()Mobile App Development (Optional):You can develop a mobile app using a framework like Kivy or Pyqt5 for user interaction. This would involve creating separate code and interfaces for the app.Testing and Debugging:Thoroughly test the entire system, identify bugs, and debug the code as needed.Deployment:Deploy the system on your hardware and in the fields.Monitoring and Maintenance:Set up a monitoring system and schedule regular maintenance for calibration and troubleshooting.
    Example Raspberry Pi Data Transmission:Here's a simplified example of how the Raspberry Pi can transmit data to a server or cloud platform. You'd need to set up a server or cloud service to receive and store the data.import requests

# Sensor data
soil_moisture = 50
temperature = 25.5
humidity = 60.0

# Define the server endpoint
server_url = "http://your_server_endpoint"

# Create a JSON payload with the sensor data
data = {
    "soil_moisture": soil_moisture,
    "temperature": temperature,
    "humidity": humidity
}

# Send a POST request to the server to transmit the data
response = requests.post(server_url, json=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Data transmitted successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to transmit data.")Example Mobile App UI:For a basic mobile app UI, you can use the Kivy framework in Python. Here's a simple example of a mobile app with a single screen displaying soil moisture data:from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout
from kivy.uix.label import Label

class IrrigationApp(App):
    def build(self):
        # Create a simple UI layout
        layout = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical')
        
        # Add a label to display soil moisture data
        soil_moisture_label = Label(text="Soil Moisture: 50%")
        layout.add_widget(soil_moisture_label)
        
        return layout

if _name_ == '_main_':
    IrrigationApp().run()
